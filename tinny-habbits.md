# Tiny Habits & Atomic Habits - Reflections

## 1. Tiny Habits - BJ Fogg

### Question 1: 
In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

- The most interesting idea was **starting small**. BJ Fogg emphasized that making tiny changes in behavior, like starting with a simple action, can help you build new habits that are sustainable in the long run. The idea that starting small creates momentum was key for me.

## 2. Tiny Habits by BJ Fogg - Core Message

### Question 2:
How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A, and P?

- **B = MAP** stands for Behavior = Motivation + Ability + Prompt. To make a new habit easier:
  - **M (Motivation):** Align the habit with something that excites you or has a high personal value.
  - **A (Ability):** Make the habit simple enough that you can do it without much effort or resources.
  - **P (Prompt):** Use cues that trigger the behavior, such as time of day or visual reminders. This makes it more likely you'll remember to do it.

### Question 3:
Why is it important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of a habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit.)

- Celebrating after completing a habit reinforces the behavior in a positive way. It triggers a sense of accomplishment and positive emotions, which strengthen the neural connection associated with the habit. Over time, this helps the habit to become automatic and ingrained.

## 3. 1% Better Every Day

### Question 4:
In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

- The most interesting idea was the concept of **1% improvement every day**. By making tiny, consistent improvements each day, you can achieve significant progress over time. The idea that small changes compound to create large results was motivating and reminded me that consistent effort leads to growth.

## 4. Book Summary of Atomic Habits

### Question 5:
What is the book's perspective about Identity?

- The book emphasizes that **identity shapes behavior**. Instead of focusing only on what you want to achieve (outcome-based goals), you should focus on becoming the type of person who does those things. For example, instead of saying "I want to run a marathon," say "I am a runner." This shift in identity reinforces long-term habits.

### Question 6:
Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do.

- The book suggests making habits **easy and frictionless** by optimizing your environment. By reducing barriers, such as preparing the needed tools or setting up cues ahead of time, the habit becomes automatic and doesn’t require much motivation. The key is to make the habit so simple that it’s hard not to do.

### Question 7:
Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do.

- To make a habit harder, **increase friction**. This can be done by removing cues or placing obstacles in the way of the habit. For example, if you want to stop watching too much TV, remove the remote from a visible location or set up a process where you have to physically move to turn the TV on.

## 5. Reflection:

### Question 8:
Pick one habit that you would like to do more of. What are the steps that you can take to make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and/or the response satisfying?

- One habit I would like to do more of is **reading**. To make the cue obvious, I can place the book on my bedside table where I will see it every morning and night. To make it more attractive, I will read books that interest me and align with my personal goals. Additionally, I will track my progress to make the response satisfying, rewarding myself after completing each chapter.

### Question 9:
Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of. What are the steps that you can take to make it invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?

- A habit I would like to do less of is **mindlessly scrolling through social media**. To make it invisible, I can remove social media apps from my phone's home screen or put them in a folder so they’re harder to access. I could also set time limits or use an app blocker to make the process harder. To make it unattractive, I could remind myself of the negative effects on my productivity and mental well-being. Finally, if I catch myself scrolling, I’ll make it unsatisfying by doing something I don't enjoy, like cleaning or tidying up, immediately afterward.
